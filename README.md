## About

TODO: Validate pair functions and write the skill around all these functions

This skill enables voice intents for the following audio receiver options on the Mycroft Mark 2 device:

- Airplay (via [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay))
- [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/)
- Spotify (via [Raspotify](https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/))
- Bluetooth

It allows you to:

- Get the status of any of these services on the Mark 2
- Enable/disable the services
- Rename your devices in Airplay/KDE Connect/Raspotify
- Pair Bluetooth/KDE Connect with other devices

Supported in Neon versions after mid-August (TODO: Specific version when it's available)
